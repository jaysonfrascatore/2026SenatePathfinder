2026 Senate Pathfinder
This is an interactive navigation tool for every possible 2026 outcome in the Senate, which is similar to my previous 2024 project, the Electoral Vote Probability Calculator.
As of January 14th, 2026, this does not act as a forecast model that makes any projections. This simply shows each possible path where Democrats and Republicans win control of the Senate, or a 50-50 tie.
If a Senate race is seen as high profile and competitive according to polling forecast models, it will be added to the 2026 Senate Pathfinder.
If a Senate race is no longer seen as competitive according to polling and forecast models, it will be removed from the pathfinder and added back to the base numbers.

Notes:
As of January 14th, 2026, Nebraska and Iowa have not met the criteria for a competitive race based on polling, forecase models, and media coverage.
